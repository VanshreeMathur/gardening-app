**Project Name** <br>
Nourish: Harvest Data Collection App

**Description** <br>
This app was designed to allow for local gardeners in Peterborough to submit and track data about the quality and quantity of crops they grow. This data is meant to allow the client, Nourish, to get a better idea of how much food is being grown by the community.

**Usage** <br>
The app uses a set of forms to take in user info and then allows the user to view that data in various graphs. It also uses a standard sign up and login so we can seperate data based on user.

**Credits** <br>
This project was worked on by: Matthew Allen, Mitchell Cummings and VanShree Mathur
